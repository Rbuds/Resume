					A <a href="http://students.washington.edu/budnir/Binary/Converter.html" target="_blank">binary converter </a> website that I worked on to convert binary bytes and integers to the opposite form.
				</li>
				<li>
					This is a client friendly website that I have created to assist people with solving <a href="http://students.washington.edu/budnir/Sudoku.html" target="_blank">Sudoku</a> puzzles. This one is a working progress and I still have many features I want to add to it but for now it can solve, by itself, most EASY* level puzzles but still has problems solving the MEDIUM* and HARD* levels on its own.
